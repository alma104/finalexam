Class Reflection
Throughout this course, I have learned about the importance of programming and developing technological skills. Furthermore, the concepts acquired in this class are very necessary to my professioal and academic life for this techniques are use to predict and to analyse the data. Personally, the experience was very interesting because with just 10 codes, all the work was done and the part of interpretation is the one that has more power and development which is necessary for the creation of the proposals for the eterprises because these are based on the graphics and the metrics the code has given us.
